# 6-Me-Ludo

A Ludo game built with Flutter and powered by Firebase.

## Features

- Up to 4 player multiplayer
- AI players
- Distinct AI personalities
- A reputation system

## Installation

You'll need to download and setup the Flutter SDK.

Don't forget to run 'flutter pub get' to get dependencies.

Create a new Firebase project.

Enable Cloud Firestore and the RTDB.

Enable Anonymous and Google Sign in for authentication.

Upload the gifs in the other_assets folder to Firebase Storage and update the urls in the GameStatusService class if necessary.

Don't forget to download the google services json file.

After that, you're good to go!

## Notable plugins and packages

I use Provider for dependency injection and use GetX for routing and localization. It's dumb really. I don't know why I'm this way ðŸ˜…

## State management and performance

I use Provider to handle state management and default to using Stateless widgets. Every now and then, I use a stateful widget when I want to do some work in the initstate method. But I try to keep these instances to a minimum.

I also try and separate parts of the UI that need to rebuild often into their own widgets to keep unnecessary rebuilds to a minimum. I also try as much as possible to avoid passing non constant values to a widget's constructor so I can take advantage of Flutter's inbuilt widget caching system and save cpu cycles during rebuilds.

A notable exception to this is the game screen. Upon testing, I noticed the child widgets of the root level StreamBuilder widget were not rebuilding. In the build method of the StreamBuilder, I call a method on the GameProvider object that accepts the snapshot data as an argument and assigns it to the game object in the GameProvider class. Since this is done in the build method of the StreamBuilder, my intuition tells me that this should trigger the other children to rebuild. (I mean it doesn't make an sense to call setState inside of a build method) However the children do not rebuild.

One work around was to call the notify listeners method wrapped inside a post frame callback. And this worked to some extent (the die widget refused to animate). But this approach of triggering rebuilds from inside a build method makes me uncomfotable.

What I am doing now is to pass the GameProvdider object from the context of the main GameScreen widget to the children through their constructors. I don't know if Flutter's caching system will still be able to cache these widgets whenever the StreamBuilder calls its build method.

I'm not experiencing jank on my physical Samsung Galaxy M11 but I still want to better optimise performance on this screen.

If you know how this can be fixed, please help.

## The Database

The actual gameplay is powered by the Realtime Database. Clients subscribe to a stream of the game object. Game objects are duplicated in Cloud Firestore due it allowing me to query game documents by user IDs present in a players array. This saves me from normalising game data and having to write extra logic sync everything up.

To save reads and writes, not all updates to the Realtime Database are synced with Firestore. Only significant events like session starts, player entries, and exits are synced up.

You'll also notice that the game thread is an array sitting on a thread object. This might (and should) cause your eyes to pop out of your head. But the reason I decided to do that was that having each message object being its own document in a separate collection would mean more documents to read and download each time a user joins a game (and a longer waiting period as the app dowloads all these documents). That could be solved with pagination but I'm trying to keep reads and writes to Firestore to an absolute minimum. I want this game to scale well and remain free. Also, I have placed a limit on the number of chat messages that can be pushed to that array. So the thread document will not reach the 1mb file size limit.

## Game and AI logic

If you value your sanity, please do not look in the GameProvider class. Avoid it like the plague. Just joking lol. While the code there is messy and in dire need of refactoring (which I will do, these past few days have been rough. I'm human too), the game logic isn't terribly complex. The game board is a simple, single dimensional array of Cell objects. The app renders this array as 15x15 grid. The positions of game pieces are just the index of the cell they are in. So when the die is rolled, I adjust the position of the selected piece based on the die value. Of course, movement on a Ludo board is not along a straight line so there is extra complexity to manage which cells a given player's pieces can occupy.

For the AI, I just generate a list of Move objects based on the possible moves available to it and then filter that list based on the AI's personality. If there are no valid moves available to it, it will simply pass its turn. Yes, this generation is done once per round. And so yes, the AI cannot really think ahead like a human can. At best, it can only prioritise which moves make the most immediate sense. The logic is extremely basic but that's why you are here to help ðŸ˜Š.

There's also a weird thing that can happen where an AI player gets stuck during its turn and the game enters and unrecoverable state. This, for once isn't a problem with the AI logic, but a result of the game running on the client instead of on a server. The logic for an AI player is executed on the client of the last human player who played before it. This isn't a problem for network drops because the Firebase SDK will cache network requests when the device goes offline and then forward pending writes when it's back online. However, if the client device loses power or the app terminates unexpectedly, the game can get stuck and the session will be unrecoverable. A potential solution is to handle the AI logic in the cloud using cloud functions. However, cold starts make this an unappealing solution right now. As usual if you have any ideas, I'm all ears.

## Roadmap

For the next major release I plan to

- Improve performance
- Switch to the RTDB
- MASSIVELY refactor the entire code base

After that, I want to

- Implement more complex AI logic
- Implement deep linking
- Implement push notifications
- Explore spotify API integration for music streaming during gameplay (controlled by host)
